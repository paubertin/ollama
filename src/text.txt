 What is LangChain?
LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language models. It enables applications that:

Are context-aware: connect a language model to sources of context (prompt instructions, few shot examples, content to ground its response in, etc.)
Reason: rely on a language model to reason (about how to answer based on provided context, what actions to take, etc.)
This framework consists of several parts.

LangChain Libraries: The Python and JavaScript libraries. Contains interfaces and integrations for a myriad of components, a basic runtime for combining these components into chains and agents, and off-the-shelf implementations of chains and agents.
LangChain Templates: (currently Python-only) A collection of easily deployable reference architectures for a wide variety of tasks.
LangServe: (currently Python-only) A library for deploying LangChain chains as a REST API.
LangSmith: A developer platform that lets you debug, test, evaluate, and monitor chains built on any LLM framework and seamlessly integrates with LangChain.
The LangChain libraries themselves are made up of several different packages.

@langchain/core: Base abstractions and LangChain Expression Language.
@langchain/community: Third party integrations.
langchain: Chains, agents, and retrieval strategies that make up an application's cognitive architecture.
Integrations may also be split into their own compatible packages.
