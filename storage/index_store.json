Until the nineteenth century, Portugal was the gateway to most of the influences that built Brazilian music, although many of these elements were not of Portuguese origin, but generally European. The first was José Maurício Nunes Garcia, author of sacred pieces with influence of Viennese classicism. The major contribution of the African element was the rhythmic diversity and some dances and instruments that had a bigger role in the development of popular music and folk, flourishing especially in the twentieth century. Popular music since the late eighteenth century began to show signs of forming a characteristically Brazilian sound, with samba considered the most typical and on the UNESCO cultural heritage list.

In 2017, the Supreme Court requested the investigation of 71 Brazilian lawmakers and nine ministers of President Michel Temer's cabinet who were allegedly linked to the Petrobras corruption scandal. President Temer himself was also accused of corruption. According to a 2018 poll, 62% of the population said that corruption was Brazil's biggest problem. In the fiercely disputed 2018 elections, the controversial conservative candidate Jair Bolsonaro of the Social Liberal Party (PSL) was elected president, winning in the second round Fernando Haddad, of the Workers Party (PT), with the support of 55.13% of the valid votes.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"FhLea56joUnuFh6w1R8LJk5bLvmzHJ4/vUqdxzVg/9s="},"7086c374-139d-4d4b-84ee-1a8dda751d4d":{"id_":"7086c374-139d-4d4b-84ee-1a8dda751d4d","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./src/tmp_data/Brazil.txt","metadata":{},"hash":"zYbs14PelRf38h9kNINvP+d0EMckEp75fS1OPOSguOY="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"4779f77e-9cd4-4b25-beb6-f9f1a46addb6","metadata":{},"hash":"FhLea56joUnuFh6w1R8LJk5bLvmzHJ4/vUqdxzVg/9s="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"077051d3-64fc-431c-95fb-b801bf14a765","metadata":{},"hash":"WJvT7IaK5m9U6KzTGAyqz0u5HMxn5jny980sV347FM4="}},"text":"In the early 2020s, Brazil became one of the hardest hit countries during the COVID-19 pandemic, receiving the second-highest death toll worldwide after the United States.

The territory which would become known as Brazil was inhabited by numerous tribal nations prior to the landing of explorer Pedro Álvares Cabral in 1500. Then, the land was claimed for the Portuguese Empire. Brazil remained a Portuguese colony until 1808, when the capital of the empire was transferred from Lisbon to Rio de Janeiro. In 1815, the colony was elevated to the rank of kingdom upon the formation of the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"c3kK/FZ5v2KV4f72eko4Erxmd/Lqdd+D9lmB2H5zZm4="},"83044d7f-7375-4256-a264-2b4a3a0531d8":{"id_":"83044d7f-7375-4256-a264-2b4a3a0531d8","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./src/tmp_data/Brazil.txt","metadata":{},"hash":"zYbs14PelRf38h9kNINvP+d0EMckEp75fS1OPOSguOY="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"70b3b13b-9798-4fa8-a8fc-61245005ce3a","metadata":{},"hash":"c3kK/FZ5v2KV4f72eko4Erxmd/Lqdd+D9lmB2H5zZm4="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"707a328d-dbfc-4e57-b336-192f396c89e6","metadata":{},"hash":"wX99i+8VZPUbCIFGhdkn9rwnGkIONofBY5mWgqdPTbs="}},"text":"Independence was achieved in 1822 with the creation of the Empire of Brazil, a unitary state governed under a constitutional monarchy and a parliamentary system.

It had the third largest prison population in the world of approximately 700,000 prisoners as of June 2014, which put it only behind the United States (2,228,424) and China (1,701,344). The high number of prisoners eventually overloaded the Brazilian prison system, leading to a shortfall of about 200,000 accommodations. === Human rights ===\n\nLGBT rights are generally supported within Brazil, and same-sex marriage has been fully recognised since 2013. However, police violence and gender-based discrimination remain prevalent throughout the nation.

Canadian mass media, both print and digital, and in both official languages, is largely dominated by a \"handful of corporations\". The largest of these corporations is the country's national public broadcaster, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, which also plays a significant role in producing domestic cultural content, operating its own radio and TV networks in both English and French. In addition to the CBC, some provincial governments offer their own public educational TV broadcast services as well, such as TVOntario and Télé-Québec.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"ZSJK0gSPse0dxO+rEsZqXY5SvJdcwHG4wEGyAq4Qig8="},"cdf78cc6-6ada-48bd-b5b0-5e7c2adb7757":{"id_":"cdf78cc6-6ada-48bd-b5b0-5e7c2adb7757","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./src/tmp_data/Canada.txt","metadata":{},"hash":"EdLk9T7447cDJ4EFpBuTil0IPZAIbeeVYkgkkLY9hRk="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"d2186a44-d0bb-4f3b-a58e-47c1f27c9ad2","metadata":{},"hash":"ZSJK0gSPse0dxO+rEsZqXY5SvJdcwHG4wEGyAq4Qig8="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"a758cefb-b5de-4bab-9e91-a746136e9a78","metadata":{},"hash":"SD6kS6kKphVPXOXGePQJwwgPoKYNVceffBRFeUbcLjc="}},"text":"Non-news media content in Canada, including film and television, is influenced both by local creators as well as by imports from the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and France.

Canadian tax laws limit foreign competition in magazine advertising. === Visual arts ===\n\nArt in Canada is marked by thousands of years of habitation by its Indigenous peoples, and, in later times, artists have combined British, French, Indigenous, and American artistic traditions, at times embracing European styles while working to promote nationalism. The nature of Canadian art reflects these diverse origins, as artists have taken their traditions and adapted these influences to reflect the reality of their lives in Canada.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"4xh0EVJR1zKP+UdbpG1eg8Pi78ng9VGAnbn8Dhs69QU="},"a758cefb-b5de-4bab-9e91-a746136e9a78":{"id_":"a758cefb-b5de-4bab-9e91-a746136e9a78","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./src/tmp_data/Canada.txt","metadata":{},"hash":"EdLk9T7447cDJ4EFpBuTil0IPZAIbeeVYkgkkLY9hRk="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"cdf78cc6-6ada-48bd-b5b0-5e7c2adb7757","metadata":{},"hash":"4xh0EVJR1zKP+UdbpG1eg8Pi78ng9VGAnbn8Dhs69QU="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"7aad1a88-c7c3-45c1-b479-257d95da9224","metadata":{},"hash":"XGTc/nwcqE1RQ8ch+yuwECwMGe/XiOGAX6eir0tgOis="}},"text":"The Canadian government has played a role in the development of Canadian culture through the department of Canadian Heritage, by giving grants to art galleries, as well as establishing and funding art schools and colleges across the country, and through the Canada Council for the Arts, the national public arts funder, helping artists, art galleries and periodicals, and thus contributing to the development of Canada's cultural works. Canadian visual art has been dominated by figures, such as painter Tom Thomson and the Group of Seven.

Canada has developed a vast music infrastructure that includes church halls, chamber halls, conservatories, academies, performing arts centres, record companies, radio stations, and television music video channels. Government support programs, such as the Canada Music Fund, assist a wide range of musicians and entrepreneurs who create, produce and market original and diverse Canadian music. As a result of its cultural importance, as well as government initiatives and regulations, the Canadian music industry is one of the largest in the world, producing internationally renowned composers, musicians, and ensembles.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"XGTc/nwcqE1RQ8ch+yuwECwMGe/XiOGAX6eir0tgOis="},"7a52ccf2-586d-49d6-821b-a9ca67f55b45":{"id_":"7a52ccf2-586d-49d6-821b-a9ca67f55b45","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./src/tmp_data/Canada.txt","metadata":{},"hash":"EdLk9T7447cDJ4EFpBuTil0IPZAIbeeVYkgkkLY9hRk="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"7aad1a88-c7c3-45c1-b479-257d95da9224","metadata":{},"hash":"XGTc/nwcqE1RQ8ch+yuwECwMGe/XiOGAX6eir0tgOis="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"3c1473f1-246d-4030-a2c9-42353fb18437","metadata":{},"hash":"JffOOyQYaGyOipmDqzyJ8Vqt6CYX7wV8PrU8nqsbtf4="}},"text":"Music broadcasting in the country is regulated by the CRTC.
